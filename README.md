### R5 - Statment of Purpose and Scope
Being a father of two young children  I'm aware that early education is vital for their development.
- The app is for learning the alphabet and basic spelling.
- The target audience is for the ages between 2-8, however this may vary slightly as each child is different.
- Learning that is fun and that can engage is always better and in the case of children, this app was no except.
- The app will have a main menu where the child (or parent) can choose between 1 of 3 options. Choosing any letter on the keyboard will allow them to see a word from either the subject of either animals or objects. There is a slightly more advanced options where instead of showing a complete word relating to the chosen letter, it will remove a random letter from the word and give them the options to guess what letter is missing.
